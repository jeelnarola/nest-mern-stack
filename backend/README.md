# ðŸš€ Node.js Project

A simple and powerful **Node.js backend project** with RESTful APIs.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a .env file and add your environment variables:
   ```bash
   PORT=
   MONGODB_URL=
   JWT_SECRET=
   CLOUD_NAME=
   CLOUD_API_KEY=
   CLOUD_API_SECRET=
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   
ðŸ‘‰ The API table uses **shields.io badges** with different colors for each request method:  
- **GET â†’ Blue**  
- **POST â†’ Green**  
- **PUT â†’ Yellow**  
- **DELETE â†’ Red**  

Do you want me to also **add examples (request & response JSON)** for each API in the README? That would make it even more like professional documentation.
